# Hello there!

👉 I’m someone who enjoys exploring the world of technology. Whether that's crafting websites or building software. I find it fascinating how technology gives us the freedom to create, experiment, and shape things however we imagine.

💻 Right now, I’m on a journey to become a full-fledged developer, open to wherever the path leads. Web, software, or something in between. I believe in learning by doing. Every step made, whether that'd be an unfinished project; a line of code written, a frustrating bug, or some little projects brought to life, each attempts made is a one step closer to that goal.

Enjoying the process, one line at a time 😊
